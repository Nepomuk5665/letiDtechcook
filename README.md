# Let iD Tech Cook üç≥

**Let iD Tech Cook** is a web-based application that generates recipe suggestions based on the food you have on hand. Upload an image of your ingredients, specify the time you have available, and let the app suggest three recipe options. The app uses an image recognition API to determine if the uploaded image contains food items, then provides customized recipes that can be prepared within your selected time frame.

## Features

- **Image Upload & Analysis:** Upload an image of your available ingredients, and the app will analyze it to determine if it contains food.
- **Custom Recipe Suggestions:** Receive three recipe options tailored to your ingredients and time constraints.
- **Full Recipe Generation:** After selecting a recipe, the app generates a detailed list of ingredients and step-by-step instructions.
- **Loading Animation:** User-friendly experience with a loading animation while the image is being processed.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is designed to work smoothly across various screen sizes.
